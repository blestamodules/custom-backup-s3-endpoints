## Issues / Requests
Adding endpoints as you may have noticed from the code is actually really simple - should you not feel comfortable with code (best to play it safe) you can create an issue requesting your custom s3 endpoint being added - you should probably open a request even if you add your own so we can add them for future people to use.

## The Future
We hope that the Blesta Team will add support for use of custom endpoints for any compatible s3 backup service - we could do this ourselves but we really don't want to be modifying more code than needed hence why this modification works just perfectly for now.
